# ShootTheBalloon
Code is not to be reused without permission.
It is a small game made in Java. It used Java swing, Mouse Listener and Mouse Action. 
Balloons are flying on the screen. You need to click on a balloon to score a point (MouseListener and mouseclick event used). You will be given 30 secs to complete the game (hence timer is also used). And graphics are made by using Java Swing components.
